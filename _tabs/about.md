My name is Brunon Bojk√≥w, I study and work on robotics. Robots have fascinated me since I was a kid, and now I am an engineer building them. 
I have worked with multiple robotics projects : 
- I started a team in FIRST robotic challenge and took the role of mechanical engineer at highschool 
- I was a Mechanical Engineer in RoboTeamTwente student team at University of Twente
- I wrote my thesis on control engineering of Dual SCARA robot 

I am also interested in the field of additive manufacturing - 3D printing. I have worked with 3D printing for over 7 years now, mainly with FDM SLA and SLS printers.


In my spare time, I'm a maker. [Here is a link to my makers portfolio.](https://messedupprojects.github.io)

Have a nice day!
