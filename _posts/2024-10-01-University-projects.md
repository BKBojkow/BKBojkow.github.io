During the three years on the university I have completed multiple group projects that were closly connected with the topic of the current study module. 
Here are some of them in chronological order: 

### Accelerometer 
During the first year me and my group have created an accelerometer. It is a scale-up of a MEMS accelerometer used in electronics. 
It works by having a mass block suspended by springs, which moves when an acceleration is present, with big capacitors plates on the sides that are used for sensing the displacement and allowing to calculate the acceleration. 
My role in this project was to design and build the mechanical part of the device. 
Below are the picture of the finished project as well as the report that we have written.

### Self Babalancing robot 
During my second year of study me and my team created a platform moving on one wheel. This construction was far from perfect - wobbly movement caused by an underpowered motor. But it still managed to move and stay in balance. 
My role in this project was to create the mechanical elements of the platform and implement the controller scheme into the microcontroler of the robot.

### Anthenna and FEM analysis
Another project from my second year was creation of directional antenna with a purpose of transmitting radio signal. Our group setteld for a Yagi-Uda antenna. 
My role in this project was to determine the optimal dimentions and the theoretical performence of the antenna, based on finite element method done in COMSOL software.

### Redesign of engine bracket
Design for additive manufacturing
During my third year I took part in Design for Additive Manufacturing course, which had a coresponding group project. Our task was to redesign an engine bracket so that is utilises all of the benefits of additive manufacturing and has improved performence compared to the existing part. This required using generative desing and finite elements method analysis in Fusion360 software.

### Coffee machine 
During my exchange in Sweden I took part in product design course, where our job was to reverse engineer a coffee machine and create a better one with improved performence and targetted at our chosen customer groups. By my suggestion we went for bauhaus style design.
