During the three years on the university I have completed multiple group projects that were closly connected with the topic of the current study module. 
Here are some of them in chronological order: 

Creating accelerometer 
During the first year me and my group have created an accelerometer. It is a scale-up of a MEMS accelerometer used in electronics. 
It works by having a mass block suspended by springs, which moves when an acceleration is present, with big capacitors plates on the sides that are used for sensing the displacement and allowing to calculate the acceleration. 
My role in this project was to design and build the mechanical part of the device. Below are the picture of the finished project as well as the report that we have written.
