### In October 24 I started working as a Mechanical Engineer in HETBOT, a spinoff from Lodz University of Technology. 
Since this company is in the start-up phase, I had many responsibilites and I did ,any different things. 

### Here are some of my duties: 
- Designing and developing components for a new generation logistics robot.  
- Creating DfAM-focused design iterations to improve manufacturability and efficiency.  
- Creating detailed manufacturing documentation and Bills of Materials (BOMs).  
- Prototyping parts using 3D printing, CNC machining, and laser cutting.  
- Managing mechanical assemblies and adapting designs to various manufacturing methods.  
- Coordinating with and negotiating subcontractors from different parts of the world.  
- Overseeing and managing component orders and supplier sourcing.  
- Supervising and mentoring student interns during project development.  

## The most fun skill that I learned was operating different CNC machines. For that I used Inventor HSM.
